This is an ongoing log of my 100 days of Machine Learning challenge

#100DaysofMLCode

<h3>Day 1 - Sunday, July 8th, 2018 </h3>
<b>Today's Progress:</b> Got a basic understanding of Reinforcement Learning and made my first attempt towards it by generating a Q-learning table for a 4x4 Frozen lake environment (OpenAI Gym).

<h3>Day 2 - Monday, July 9th, 2018 </h3>
<b>Today's Progress:</b> Today I created an AI that plays the game Starcraft. It is still pretty basic, and there has been no ML algorithm applied, but I guess it's acceptable, as there were many things to set up, which included installing a 30GB game.

<h3>Day 3 - Tuesday, July 10th, 2018 </h3>
<b>Today's Progress:</b> My AI can now complete a game with quite good results. The strategy is still hard coded, but it already beat a Computer bot at Medium Difficulty. I expect to apply some kind of learning algorithm tomorrow.

<h3>Day 4 - Wednesday, July 11th, 2018 </h3>
<b>Today's Progress:</b> Applying machine learning into the AI is more complicated than I thought it would. I think part of the reason was that I do not have much knowledge of the game itself, so I only tried to make the machine fine-tuned those variables that I previously hard-coded using Q-Learning. Apparently, that did not make many differences, since there are quite a few other variables that I need to take into consideration to win such a complicatedly strategic game. I don't think I have yet enough knowledge (regarding the game, and regarding Reinforcement Learning) and patience to create that many variables, and I don't think my machine can even handle that much learning at once. I will try to find another solution tomorrow.
