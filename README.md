This is an ongoing log of my 100 days of Machine Learning challenge

#100DaysofMLCode

<h3>Day 1 - Sunday, July 8th, 2018 </h3>
<b>Today's Progress:</b> Got a basic understanding of Reinforcement Learning and made my first attempt towards it by generating a Q-learning table for a 4x4 Frozen lake environment (OpenAI Gym).

<h3>Day 2 - Monday, July 9th, 2018 </h3>
<b>Today's Progress:</b> Today I created an AI that plays the game Starcraft. It is still pretty basic, and there has been no ML algorithm applied, but I guess it's acceptable, as there were many things to set up, which included installing a 30GB game.

<h3>Day 3 - Tuesday, July 10th, 2018 </h3>
<b>Today's Progress:</b> My AI can now complete a game with quite good results. The strategy is still hard coded, but it already beat a Computer bot at Medium Difficulty. I expect to apply some kind of learning algorithm tomorrow.
